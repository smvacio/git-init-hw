This was a homework assignment for the coding bootcamp I am currently attending. This assignment was completed on June 18, 2022. This project was completed independently using a beginning code obtained from this source: https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram 

For this module's first project, the challenge was on accessibility, which is crucial for developing websites. I tidied up the initial code and included additional instructions for making the website more accessible.
